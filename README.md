## PolarPals

PolarPals is a platform that is based around a common goal of all Bowdoin students: sharing. It is a digital space for Bowdoin students to share textbooks and form study groups. With the Textbooks section of our website, users can sell, rent buy or exchange textbooks with other students who may have taken the class previously. The Study Groups section on the other hand allows users to form groups to work on assignments or study for exams.
