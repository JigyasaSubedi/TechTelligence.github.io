## PolarPals

PolarPals is a platform that is based around a common goal of all Bowdoin students: sharing. It is a digital space for Bowdoin students to share textbooks and form study groups. With the Textbooks section of our website, users can sell, rent buy or exchange textbooks with other students who may have taken the class previously. The Study Groups section on the other hand allows users to form groups to work on assignments or study for exams.

## Getting Started

You only need access to a stable internet connection to use our website. Our website is best viewed on Google Chrome. To get started, you can go to: (https://jigyasasubedi.github.io/TechTelligence.github.io/)

## Usage

Note: This is not a fully functioning website yet. It is more a demo of what the final product would look like. So, as you explore the website, please keep in mind that not all links will work. As of now, this demo version allows you to explore the website as a user who has already logged in to the system.

1) Upon clicking [this link](https://jigyasasubedi.github.io/TechTelligence.github.io/), you will reach the homepage of the website. After reaching the homepage, you are exposed to mutliple different options. 
2) If you wish to explore either the Textbooks or Study Groups section, they are available to you at the center of the webpage. Both of these sections are similar in layout, however, the contents differ. Upon clicking on one of these sections, you will be taken to the course page. Here, you can look at posts, comment on posts, save posts and even make your own posts. All of these features are available to you for all of the courses you are taking currently. You can change these using the 'Select Class' button. Alternatively, you also have the option of exploring posts for courses that you are not taking currently.
3) Should you choose to explore another section of the website, you can do so using the navigation bar at the top of your page or the footer at the bottom of your page. These options are available to you at all times while you are using the website, regardless of which page you are at currently.
4) You can also customize what is displayed to you. If you click on the Manage Profile section, located on the drop down menu, you can change your courses, view your saved posts, and also change your personal information.
